# Final Agent

this repository hosts the "final agent" system I've designed. Tightly integrated with my other systems, it aims to be the final agent system I'll ever need for extensible agents in simulations and games.

## Features

- multi-tiered finite state machine
- realistic vision system for determing friends and foes
- memory of other agents (last position, assumed allegiance, etc)
- dynamic pathfinding for cover, flanking, etc.
- stats(Combat Skill, Perception, Reaction time)
- traits(TO BE DESIGNED)
- full multiplayer support
